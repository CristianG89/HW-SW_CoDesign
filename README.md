# HW-SW_CoDesign
SPI-based communication between two FPGAs. Bidirectional communication with MOSI and MISO to activate one FPGA leds by using the other FPGA switches.

Implementation done in VHDL (RTL desgin and testbench).
The IDE used was Lattice Diamond (design) and ModelSim (validation), and the FPGAs used were Lattice XP2 EV.

Lecture from master "Embedded System for Mechatronics" in FH Dortmund.
